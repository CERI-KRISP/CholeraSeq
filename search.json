    "text": "Running the pipeline\n\nTest profiles\nA built-in test profile are available in the choleraseq pipeline with different size of datasets. This profile can be used to run tests on the relevant infrastructure using the bundled test datasets (published on Zenodo), to help users identify and resolve any infrastructural issue before the analysis stage.\nNOTE: The snippets below assumes you have docker on the sever/machine you wish to test the pipeline. For other institutional configs please refer nf-core/configs project, which are all applicable to this pipeline.\n\n$ nextflow run CERI-KRISP/CholeraSeq \\\n  -profile test,docker --outdir test_output\n\n\nUsing your own dataset\nThe command for running the pipeline is as follows:\nnextflow run ceri-krisp/choleraseq \\\n         -profile docker \\\n         --samplesheet /path/to/samplesheet.csv \\\n         --outdir results\nThis will launch the pipeline with the docker configuration profile. See below for more information about profiles.\nNote that the pipeline will create the following files in your working directory:\nwork                # Directory containing the nextflow working files\n&lt;OUTDIR&gt;            # Finished results in specified location (defined with --outdir)\n.nextflow_log       # Log file from Nextflow\n# Other nextflow hidden files, eg. history of pipeline runs and old logs.\n\n\nUse of YAML file for parameters\nIf you wish to repeatedly use the same parameters for multiple runs, rather than specifying each flag in the command, you can specify these in a params file.\nPipeline settings can be provided in a yaml or json file via -params-file &lt;file&gt;.\n\n⚠️ Do not use -c &lt;file&gt; to specify parameters as this will result in errors. Custom config files specified with -c must only be used for tuning process resource specifications, other infrastructural tweaks (such as output directories), or module arguments (args).\n\nThe above pipeline run specified with a params file in yaml format:\nnextflow run ceri-krisp/choleraseq -profile docker -params-file params.yaml\nwith params.yaml containing:\ninput: './samplesheet.csv'\noutdir: './results/'\ngenome: 'GRCh37'\n&lt;...&gt;\nYou can also generate such YAML/JSON files via nf-core/launch.\n\n\nUpdating the pipeline\nWhen you run the above command, Nextflow automatically pulls the pipeline code from GitHub and stores it as a cached version. When running the pipeline after this, it will always use the cached version if available - even if the pipeline has been updated since. To make sure that you’re running the latest version of the pipeline, make sure that you regularly update the cached version of the pipeline:\nnextflow pull ceri-krisp/choleraseq\n\n\nReproducibility\nIt is a good idea to specify a pipeline version when running the pipeline on your data. This ensures that a specific version of the pipeline code and software are used when you run your pipeline. If you keep using the same tag, you’ll be running the same version of the pipeline, even if there have been changes to the code since.\nFirst, go to the ceri-krisp/choleraseq releases page and find the latest pipeline version - numeric only (eg. 1.3.1). Then specify this when running the pipeline with -r (one hyphen) - eg. -r 1.3.1. Of course, you can switch to another version by changing the number after the -r flag.\nThis version number will be logged in reports when you run the pipeline, so that you’ll know what you used when you look back in the future. For example, at the bottom of the MultiQC reports.\nTo further assist in reproducbility, you can use share and re-use parameter files to repeat pipeline runs with the same settings without having to write out a command with every single parameter.\n\n💡 If you wish to share such profile (such as upload as supplementary material for academic publications), make sure to NOT include cluster specific paths to files, nor institutional specific profiles.",

Profiles can give configuration presets for different compute environments.\nSeveral generic profiles are bundled with the pipeline which instruct the pipeline to use software packaged using different methods (Docker, Singularity, Podman, Shifter, Charliecloud, Apptainer, Conda) - see below.\n\nWe highly recommend the use of Docker or Singularity containers for full pipeline reproducibility, however when this is not possible, Conda is also supported.\n\nThe pipeline also dynamically loads configurations from https://github.com/nf-core/configs when it runs, making multiple config profiles for various institutional clusters available at run time. For more information and to see if your system is available in these configs please see the nf-core/configs documentation.\nNote that multiple profiles can be loaded, for example: -profile test,docker - the order of arguments is important! They are loaded in sequence, so later profiles can overwrite earlier profiles.\nIf -profile is not specified, the pipeline will run locally and expect all software to be installed and available on the PATH. This is not recommended, since it can lead to different results on different machines dependent on the computer enviroment.\n\ntest\n\nA profile with a complete configuration for automated testing\nIncludes links to test data so needs no other parameters\n\ndocker\n\nA generic configuration profile to be used with Docker\n\nsingularity\n\nA generic configuration profile to be used with Singularity\n\npodman\n\nA generic configuration profile to be used with Podman\n\nshifter\n\nA generic configuration profile to be used with Shifter\n\ncharliecloud\n\nA generic configuration profile to be used with Charliecloud\n\napptainer\n\nA generic configuration profile to be used with Apptainer\n\nconda\n\nA generic configuration profile to be used with Conda.

Nextflow will use cached results from any pipeline steps where the inputs are the same, continuing from where it got to previously. For input to be considered the same, not only the names must be identical but the files’ contents as well.

    "text": "Custom configuration\n\nResource requests\nWhilst the default requirements set within the pipeline will hopefully work for most people and with most input data, you may find that you want to customise the compute resources that the pipeline requests. Each step in the pipeline has a default set of requirements for number of CPUs, memory and time. For most of the steps in the pipeline, if the job exits with any of the error codes specified here it will automatically be resubmitted with higher requests (2 x original, then 3 x original). If it still fails after the third attempt then the pipeline execution is stopped.\nTo change the resource requests, please see the max resources and tuning workflow resources section of the nf-core website.\n\n\nCustom Containers\nIn some cases you may wish to change which container or conda environment a step of the pipeline uses for a particular tool. By default nf-core pipelines use containers and software from the biocontainers or bioconda projects. However in some cases the pipeline specified version maybe out of date.\nTo use a different container from the default container or conda environment specified in a pipeline, please see the updating tool versions section of the nf-core website.\n\n\nCustom Tool Arguments\nA pipeline might not always support every possible argument or option of a particular tool used in pipeline. Fortunately, nf-core pipelines provide some freedom to users to insert additional parameters that the pipeline does not include by default.\nTo learn how to provide additional arguments to a particular tool of the pipeline, please see the customising tool arguments section of the nf-core website.\n\n\nnf-core/configs\nIn most cases, you will only need to create a custom config as a one-off but if you and others within your organisation are likely to be running nf-core pipelines regularly and need to use the same settings regularly it may be a good idea to request that your custom config file is uploaded to the nf-core/configs git repository. Before you do this please can you test that the config file works with your pipeline of choice using the -c parameter. You can then create a pull request to the nf-core/configs repository with the addition of your config file, associated documentation file (see examples in nf-core/configs/docs), and amending nfcore_custom.config to include your custom profile.\nSee the main Nextflow documentation for more information about creating your own configuration files.\nIf you have any questions or issues please send us a message on Slack on the #configs channel.",
